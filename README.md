# Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

Inspiration taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg).

## How does it work?
The algorithm follows two rules.
- If the given number is even, divide the number by 2.
- If the given number is odd, multiply the number by 3 and add 1 to it.

This goes on and on until it eventually reaches 1.
